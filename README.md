# The worldwidetelescope.org “user” website

The user-facing portion of the [AAS](https://aas.org/)
[WorldWide Telescope](http://worldwidetelescope.org/home) (WWT) website —
various mostly-static pages but not the
[web client](https://github.com/worldwidetelescope/wwt-web-client) or the
[API](https://github.com/worldwidetelescope/wwt-website) or the
[Communities](https://github.com/worldwidetelescope/wwt-website) component of
the web app.

WWT is a free, open-source tool for showcasing astronomical data and
knowledge. WWT is brought to you by the non-profit
[American Astronomical Society] (AAS) and the [.NET Foundation]. Established
in 1899 and based in Washington, DC, the AAS is the major organization of
professional astronomers in North America.

## Getting involved

We love it when people get involved in the WWT community! You can get started
by [participating in our user forum] or by
[signing up for our low-traffic newsletter]. If you would like to help make
WWT better, our [Contributor Hub] aims to be your one-stop shop for
information about how to contribute to the project, with the
[Contributors’ Guide] being the first thing you should read. Here on GitHub we
operate with a standard [fork-and-pull] model.

## URL structure

The files in this repository drive the following URL paths of the main WWT
website. The ones labeled *static* contain static content that is simply
served up by the server. The rest contain dynamic content generated by the
ASP.NET MVC5 application on the fly.

- /About/
- /Content/ — *static*
- /Download/
- /favicon.ico — *static*
- /fonts/ — *static*
- /GetInvolved/
- /Home
- /Learn/
- /Scripts/ — *static*
- /Support/
- /Terms/
- /Upgrade/
- /Use/

Much of the dynamically-served content, however, could just as well be turned
into static content at some point. But in the interests of continuity, we're
sticking with the active content for the time being.
