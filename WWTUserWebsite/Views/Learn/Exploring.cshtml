          <p>Guided tours drive WorldWide Telescope to show visuals to present
          a topic or tell a story. Tours show data as a series of slides with
            transitions between view points and visualizations.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir\learn\Guided%20Tours%20Tab.jpg" alt="Guided Tours" />

          <p>You can browse a library of tours by clicking “Guided Tours” tab.
          You can also save and share tours yourself. If you are browsing from
          within WorldWide Telescope, you will see a list of categories, such
          as “Learning WWT” and “Planets.”</p>

          <p>Within each category is a list of Tours; as you mouse over each
          you will see a description and can download it by clicking the Play
          button.</p> <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Play%20Tour%20from%20List.jpg" alt="Play
          Guided Tour" />

          <p>Some tours take a few seconds to download. When it is finished
          downloading, the tour title will show up right of the uppermost
          menu. If you interrupt the tour to explore you can return to the
          tour by clicking the title.</p>

          alt="Play loaded tour" />

          <p>Pushing Play after the tour is downloaded starts the tour. Tours
          play full screen. If the mouse is over the menus they will keep on
          top of the tour, so move it to the display to hide all menus.</p>

          <p>You can hit F11 to go back and forth between a windowed and full
          screen view of WWT.</p>

          <p>When the tour is running you can skip to a slide by clicking on
          the desired slide or use the arrow keys to go forward or backward
          through the slide list. You can pause the tour by clicking the Pause
            button on the left of the slides.</p>

          <p>You can edit the tour and then save your changes to a local copy
          you can share. We will talk more about authoring tours in another
          tutorial, but you can start making content by first making edits to
            existing tutorials.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"

          <p>Note, tours can have separate narration and music tracks and you
          can adjust the volume of each separately. Once you have saved a
          local copy you can update that saved version by clicking the Save
          button.</p>

          <p>WorldWide Telescope allows you to explore real images obtained
          from some of the world’s most advanced telescopes. These are the
          same images that professional astronomers use in their research.</p>

          <p>When you are in Explore mode, you can investigate the current
          view in more detail. You can zoom in and out using the Page-Up and
          Page-Down keys on your keyboard or the scroll wheel on your mouse.
          You can move your view by clicking and moving your mouse in the main
          window. You can also rotate the view by holding down the control key
          while you move your mouse.</p>

          <p>
            In the left-hand part of the lower menu, there is a pull-down to
            select what you are looking at and what imagery is displayed. You
            can look at the Sky, which is what you are looking at now.
          </p>

          data-coords="887,74" />

          <p>
            You can also select an exact image of the Sky with the Imagery
            pull-down. Currently, you are looking at the optical view of the
            Sky, as captured by the Digitized Sky Survey. You can use the
            Imagery pull-down to see the Sky in other wavelengths, such as
            this infrared view of the sky from the IRAS satellite.
          </p>

          data-coords="887,74" />

          <p>You can also look at Earth, which brings up a 3D view of our
          planet as seen from space. Note that this view only shows the Earth
          and does not include the effect of lighting from the Sun. Just a
            blue marble in an empty universe.</p>

          <p>You can look at Planets, and other solar system worlds, such as
          Mars. These views also show just the body of interest by itself.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/LookAtMars.jpg" alt="look at mars"
          data-coords="890,84" />

          <p>In the next viewing mode, you can look at various Panoramas,
          which are wrap-around images taken from the surface of Earth, Mars,
            and Earth’s Moon.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/LookAtPano.jpg" alt="look at moon"
          data-coords="889,77" />

          <p>The last viewing mode allows you to explore a 3d model of the
          Solar System, and indeed the entire universe, at least as much of it
          where we have good models. The major components included are the
          Solar System, which includes planets, dwarf planets, moons and
          asteroids. Beyond the Solar System is the Hippoarcos catalog of
          stars. Then further out is a model of the Milky Way including a face
          on artistic view of our galaxy. Pulling further out galaxies from
          the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are shown.</p>

            In addition to looking at the sky in various ways, WorldWide
            Telescope can view planets from orbit or the surface. In order to
            do this we have to select
            <strong>Look At</strong> to either “SolarSystem” or “Planet”.
            Looking at the Planet isolates the planet and does not show the
            sky as a background. Your motion is also only relative to the
            center of the selected planet.
          </p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/look_at_dropdown.jpg" alt="Look at solar
                                                              system or planet" />

          <p>
            You can also
            <strong>Look At</strong> SolarSystem. This allows you to
            investigate all the bodies of our solar system. For this example
            we will explore Earth as it has the largest amount of information.
            First, we have to enable the display of the most detailed
            datasets. This is done in the
            <strong>Layer Manager</strong> controls on the left side of the
            screen or selected
            <strong>Show Layer Manager</strong> under the
            <strong>View</strong> menu. Under 3d Solar System, make sure
            “Mulit-Res Solar System Bodies” is checked.
          </p>

          <p> Now under the Earth object you can adjust what datasets you see.
          To see the most realistic clouds, select “8k Cloud Textures.” </p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/8k_cloud_textures.jpg" alt="Multi res 8k
          cloud textures" />

          <p>
            In order to see some additional data you will have to be
            <strong>looking at</strong> the Earth rather than SolarSystem.
            Let’s select that now.
          </p>

          <p> One interesting thing you can do is view a cutaway of the Earth
          that shows the interior layers of structure. You can select this
          view in the Layer Manager on the left. </p>

          <img class="img-responsive img-border"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/earth_core.jpg" alt="Earth Core" />

          <p> Let’s put the Earth back to together and look at how we can view
          the surface. </p>

          <p>
            By default Earth views show 3d terrain and aerial data from Bing
            Maps. Note, that when
            <strong>looking at</strong> the Earth there is not a sky behind to
            view so atmospheric effects will be different than when viewing
            Earth in the
            <strong>Look At </strong>SolarSystem mode.

          <p>Astronomical Images, defined as those with overlay sky
          coordinates can be loaded directly into WorldWide Telescope (WWT) in
          several ways.</p>

          <h5>Loading Local AVM-tagged Images</h5>

          <p>Astronomical Visual Metadata (AVM) is a way to storing
          information about the original astronomical image in the header of a
          standard image file, such as TIFF and JPEG. This standard uses
          existing header infrastructure and populates it with
          astronomy-specific metadata. The relevant metadata to WWT is:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Image Name</li>
            <li>URL</li>
            <li>Credits</li>
            <li>Caption</li>
            <li>World Coordinate System (WCS) coordinate information</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The idea behind AVM is to allow visualizers to manipulate colors,
          add annotations etc. and maintain the description of that
          manipulation – e.g., original data location, color representation –
          so that subsequent people know how it was created and how to
          interpret it. For WWT, coordinates allow the image to be placed at
          the correct location on the sky.</p>

          <p>
            You can download AVM-tagged data from a variety of data sources.
            If your favorite source of image data provider doesn’t currently
            include AVM tags, you can direct them to the AVM resources below.
            If you want to get a test image, you can browse for one in the
            Astropix website, which aggregates AVM-tagged images -
            <a href="http://astropix.ipac.caltech.edu/"
            target="astropix">http://astropix.ipac.caltech.edu/</a>. Once you
            have it, you can add the data to WWT by:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are in Sky Mode.</li>
            <li>Under the Explore Tab, click on Open/Astronomical Image…</li>
            <li>Browse to the appropriate file. </li>
            <li>WWT will load the data into WWT and add it to a default
            collection called “Open Collections,” shown in the upper left-hand
            part of WWT. You can right click and add it to a collection of
            your choice for image organization after you have loaded it.</li>
            <li>You can right-click on the image in the collection and select
            “Properties” to see the image, coordinates, image name, caption,
            URL. These values are all pulled from the AVM tags when the file
            is read.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the cross-fader to change the opacity of this
            overlaid image on top of the current background.</li>
            <li>You can also adjust the Image Alignment by pressing CTRL+E to
            open the Image Alignment instructions.</li>
          </ol>

          <br />

          <p>
            <img class="img-responsive img-border"
            src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/image_alignment.jpg" alt="image alignment
            instructions" data-coords="00,32" />
          </p>

          <h5>Loading Remotely-served AVM-tagged Images</h5>

          <p>In a similar fashion, you can point your browser to an AVM-tagged
          image on the Internet and it will show the image in your browser in
          a similar overlay using web controls, with a link to view the image
          in WWT. Clicking this send this image to the WWT desktop client and
          allows display control and exploration, similar to interaction with
          local AVM-tagged Images, above. You can try this out for
          yourself.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Open the following URL in your browser -
              <a href="//worldwidetelescope.org/Developers/ImportImage">//worldwidetelescope.org/Developers/ImportImage</a>
              - or click on “Develop &gt; Import Image” in this documentation.
            </li>

            <li>
              Paste the URL to this composite X-ray and Infrared image of
              Puppis A, which has already been AVM-tagged into the Image URL
              input field on the web-page. You can also put the URL of the
              AVM-tagged image after the URL to the image import page,
              separated by “#”, as:
              <a href="//worldwidetelescope.org/Developers/ImportImage#http://images.ipac.caltech.edu/spitzer/sig14-022/spitzer_sig14-022_2051.jpg">//worldwidetelescope.org/Developers/ImportImage#http://images.ipac.caltech.edu/spitzer/sig14-022/spitzer_sig14-022_2051.jpg</a>
            </li>

            <li>This will open the image the webpage with control over image
            cross-fade and full-screen in the lower right. You can also click
            the button to the left of the cross-fader which opens the image in
            the WWT desktop client.</li>
          </ol>

          </p>

          <h5>Loading FITS Files</h5>

          <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are in Sky Mode.</li>
            <li>Under the Explore Tab, click on Open/Astronomical Image…</li>
            <li>Browse to the appropriate FITS data file. This can be pulled
            from the Internet or from an attached telescope or a local
            file. </li>
            <li>WWT will load the FITS file into WWT and add it to a default
            collection called “Open Collections,” shown in the upper left-hand
            part of WWT. You can right click and add it to a collection of
            your choice for image organization after you have loaded it.</li>
            <li>Note that FITS files contain pixels, which are mapped to
            physical coordinates, and data values. To view the image data
            values must be mapped to colors. The default color map is a linear
            greyscale one where the lowest value is mapped to black and the
            highest to white, with linear steps in between. You can
            interactively adjust this mapping by clicking on the Scale button,
            which opens the Histogram dialog box. </li>
            <li>In the Histogram dialog you can select the mapping function
            between Linear, Log, Power, Square Root and Histogram
            Equalization.</li>
            <li>You can change the minimum and maximum data ranges by moving
            the red and green vertical lines, respectively. If you move the
            green line to the left of the red line, this inverts the mapping
            and low values will be show white and high values black.</li>
            <li>Grabbing the blue circle in the middle will allow you to keep
            the mapping function width of the function and move it through the
            histogram left and right.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the cross-fader to change the opacity of this
            overlaid image on top of the current background.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>WWT can read Web Mapping Service (WMS) data from various data
          services. WMS data are served by various sources, and often show
          time-varying map overlays which can be displayed on the Earth or
          planets. In the example below, we will add a time-sequence of WMS
          maps showing wild fires in Yellowstone, but a similar process would
          be used to add other mapping data for other planets.</p>

          <img class="img-responsive"
          src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/mapping_data.jpg" alt="mapping data" />

          <ol>
            <li>In the Layer Manager, under the Sun, right-click on the Earth
            and select "New WMS Layer" to bring up the WMS wizard. </li>

            <li>
              In this example, we will use the default server at NASA Goddard
              Space Flight Center, which is identified by the Web Mapping
              Service URL field “
              <a target="_blank"
              href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wms">http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wms</a>.”
              You could also enter a URL from the list below or construct your
              own list to choose from. Set the “Server Name” to something like
              “Goddard” and click the "Add Server" button to add this to your
              Server List.
            </li>

            <li>
              Click on “Goddard (
              <a href="http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wms"
              target="_blank">http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/wms</a>), and
              then click the “Get Layers Button” receive a list of available
              layers.
            </li>

            <li>Data providers categorize WMS data; for this example, expand –
            by pressing the “+” to the left of “Agriculture,” and then further
            expand the “Wildlife Growth around Yellowstone National Park in
            1988” to show “Wildlife Growth around Yellowstone National Park in
              1988 (1024x1024 Animation).”</li>

            <img class="img-responsive"
            src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/wildlife_growth.jpg" alt="yellowstone
                 wildlife growth" />

            <li>Then press the “Add” button in the lower right. Close the
            dialog box by clicking “Close” to the right of “Add” button. Now
            in the Layer Manager under Sun/Earth, there is a layer entitled
            “Wildlife Growth around Yellowstone National Park in 1988
            (1024x1024 Animation).”</li>

            <li>Since these data represent a time sequence as you scrub
            through time in the SolarSystem mode, the lighting and Earth
            rotation will change as well and you will not view the same
            location on the Earth as time changes. To be able to scrub through
            time, you should Look At: Earth.</li>

            <li>Make sure the checkbox next to “Wildlife Growth around
            Yellowstone National Park in 1988 (1024x1024 Animation)” under
            Sun/Earth in the Layer Manager is checked.</li>

            <li>Find Yellowstone National Park on the Earth.</li>

            <li>Move the Time Scrubber, which is shown below the Layer
            Manager. You will see a sequence of different maps. Note, the
            colors are chosen by the WMS data provider and you should go to
            the data source to find out what the color represent. Note, that
            as you move the Time Scrubber, Observing Time in the View tab also
            shows the detailed time/date.</li>

          <p>VO Tables are a standard exchange format of catalog data and
          queries to registries allow you to find, plot and interact with a
          wide variety of catalogs that have VO table interfaces.</p>

          <p>First orient the view to a location, for this example the
          Pleiades open cluster.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are in Sky mode.</li>
            <li>Under the Search Tab, select &ldquo;SIMBAD
            Search&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>
              Enter &ldquo;pleiades&rdquo; in the search box. This will orient
              your view to the Pleiades cluster and zoom in. <br />
              <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/simbad_search.jpg" alt="screen

            <li>Next under the Search Tab, open the &ldquo;VO Cone
            Search/Registry Lookup&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
            <li>
              In the field &ldquo;NVO Registry Title Like&rdquo; enter
              &ldquo;Pleiades.&rdquo; And Click &ldquo;NVO Registry
              Search&rdquo; button. <br />

              Registry Search Button" />
            </li>
            <li>This will populate the bottom of the table with a list of
            registries (registered catalogs in this case).</li>
            <li>
              Click on a row to search that catalog. This will load values
              into &ldquo;Base URL.&rdquo; For this example select
              &ldquo;ZYJHK photometry in Pleiades&hellip;&rdquo; Since you are
              looking at the location of the Pleiades, you can click the
              checkbox next to &ldquo;from View.&rdquo; Set the Verbosity
              pull-down to &ldquo;Medium&rdquo; in order to return photometric
              measurements at all observed bands, rather than the default
              positions if the default &ldquo;Low&rdquo; is used. Then click
              &ldquo;Search&rdquo; on the right. <br />

            </li>
            <li>
              This will plot the catalog entries of the returned table on the
              background sky image. The default is to plot circles at each
              location. Also, this table is added as a layer (default name is
              &ldquo;VO Table&rdquo;) under the &ldquo;Sky&rdquo; of the Layer
              Manager on the left. If you close this table, you can always
              right-click on the &ldquo;VO Table&rdquo; in the layer manager
              and select &ldquo;VO Table Viewer.&rdquo; <br />

            </li>

            <li>Clicking on an entry of the returned table will center the
            display on the location of the catalog entry and show a
            label.</li>
            <li>
              10. You can right-click on the VO Table layer in the layer
              manager and select
              <strong>Copy</strong> and then you can paste the table into an
              Excel spreadsheet.
            </li>
            <li>
              To do plotting, you can use TOPCAT, which is a free Java program
              available here:
              <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/</a>.
              First download
              <em>and run</em> TOPCAT &ndash; by double-clicking on the
              topcat-full.jar file.
            </li>
            <li>Then in the VO Table Viewer click the &ldquo;Broadcast&rdquo;
            button. This uses the SAMP messaging protocol to send the
            retrieved VO Table to TOPCAT for plotting.</li>
            <li>
              In TOPCAT, you can then select setup a scatter plot, but
              clicking the icon at the top menu. <br />
              <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/topcat.jpg" class="img-responsive
              img-border" alt="Screen shot of TOPCAT scatter plot selection"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              This brings up a scatter plot window. You can map columns to
              axes in the plotting window. <br />

            </li>
            <li>You can also save the current table out of TOPCAT as Comma
            Separated Variable (CSV) format for input into Excel.</li>

          <h5>Layers</h5>

          <p>WorldWide Telescope can show many layers and types of data. A
          layer is an object or a dataset that can be placed into your viewing
          window. There are many types of layers you can create, such as
          importing 3D objects, or displaying aurora evolution over time
          overlaid on the high latitudes of the Earth. This tutorial will
          demonstrate how to create a layer that displays the traverse trail
          of the Curiosity rover on Mars within Gale Crater towards Aeolis
          Mons (Mt Sharp). The Layer Manager is located in the lower left of
          the screen and can be toggled on/off. </p>

          <p>
            <img class="img-responsive img-border"
            src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Layer%20Manager%201.jpg" />
          </p>

          <p>
            Within the Layer Manager, you can check boxes on and off to show
            the different visualizations that are built into WWT. Expanding
            the
            <strong>Earth</strong> menu will show six children layers,
            including
            <strong>Overlays</strong>, the
            <strong>Moon</strong> and the
            <strong>ISS</strong>. Likewise for
            <strong>Mars</strong>, the only options are
            <strong>Phobos and Deimos</strong>.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              To create our own layer for Mars, we first need to ensure that
              the Layerscape Excel Add-In is installed for your computer,
              which can be found here:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Sol</strong> is the number of Martian day since landing
              (0).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LMST</strong> is Local Mean Solar Time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ET</strong> is ephemeral time, or seconds elapsed since
              1/1/2000, so subtracting ET at landing (Sol 0) from another data
              point gives elapsed mission time in seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Longitude and Latitude</strong> are from a reference
              point that is defined with WWT.
              <strong>Altitude</strong> is the elevation of the rover with
              respect to datum, essentially sea level for Mars.

            <li>
              Change the

            <li>
              Under the
              <strong>Marker</strong> tab change the color to lime green
              (shows up very well on Mars and is my favorite color).
              <strong>Hover Text</strong> should be none,
              <strong>Scale Type</strong> Constant, and
              <strong>Scale Factor</strong> can start at 1 or larger (it will
              be easy to find if its bigger and you don’t know where Gale
              Crater is located off the top of your head). Eventually we will
              want to change the Scale Factor to the smallest scale but we can
              do this through the layer property editor in WWT.
              <strong>Marker Type</strong> should be Point.

          <p>
            In WWT you should see the
            <strong>Curiosity Traverse</strong> layer as a child of Mars (if
            not, check to make sure it isn’t under Earth, in which case you
            need to adjust the reference frame in Excel). Make sure the layer
            is turned on and find Gale Crater, you will see a large green
            marker.

        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>You can print 3D terrains from Solar System bodies from WorldWide
          Telescope. This could be done to create a 3d model of mountains,
          canyons or other terrain. Currently 3D surface data is available for
          the Earth, the Moon and Mars. You can select a region and then use
          WWT to create a file for printing in the Standard Tessellation
          Language (STL) format.</p>

          <h5>Steps</h5>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Startup WorldWide Telescope. <br /> <img class="img-responsive
              img-border" src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/EarthandPlanet.jpg" alt="3d
              printing" />
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the
              <strong>Look At</strong> mode to the
              <strong>Earth</strong> or the
              <strong>Planet</strong> of your choice. For this example, we
              will use Mars. Select
              <strong>Look At</strong> to be
              <strong>Planet</strong> and then in the selection to the right
              select
              <strong>Mars Visible Imagery</strong>. <br />
              <img class="img-responsive img-border"
              src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Olympus%20Mons.jpg" alt="olympus mons"
              />
            </li>
            <li>
              Move the view to show the region you want to print. In this
              example we will make a model of Olympus Mons, which is the
              largest mountain on any planet of our Solar System – almost
              three times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level.
              <br /> <img class="img-responsive img-border"
              src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/STL%20Dialog.jpg" alt="STL dialog" />
            </li>
            <li>
              To print the terrain that is in view, choose
              <strong>Export Current View as STL File for 3D
              Printing…</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              This will show a default region selection in yellow and bring up
              a dialog box where you can adjust exactly what is printed.
              <br /> <img class="img-responsive img-border"
              src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Export%20STL.jpg" alt="Export" />
            </li>
            <li>First you should make sure to define the region of the surface
            terrain you want to print. You can grab and adjust one of the
            yellow region handles in the main view or enter the latitude and
            longitude coordinates in decimal degrees in the box.</li>
            <li>
              Next you can select the
              <strong>Density</strong> of model. Higher densities show more
              detail but the file sizes will be larger.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can then specify the thickness of the base of the 3D printed
              model by changing the value of
              <strong>Base (mm)</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              By default the elevation is at 100%. All the planets in our
              Solar System are large and massive; and relative to the size of
              the planets even the highest mountains don’t deviate from the
              planet’s spherical shape. So you might want to exaggerate the
              vertical scale of the terrain by making the
              <strong>Elevation %</strong> to be greater than 100%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press the
              <strong>Export</strong> button which will open a box where you
              can specify the location and name of the output STL file.
            </li>
            <li>You can then print out the STL file on your attached 3D
            printer using a program, such as “3D Builder” or “MakerBot
            Desktop”.</li>

          </p>

          <p>
            John Zuhone wrote a very nice python package &ndash;
            <a href="http://www.jzuhone.com/pywwt/index.html">pyWWT</a>
            &ndash; that allows data import directly into WorldWide Telescope.
            Mark SubbaRao used this package to load and visualize
            extragalactic data into WWT and has written up an IPython notebook
            to illustrate the process.
          </p>

          <p>This document will go through the install from nuts to bolts to
          reproduce this visualization to learn more about using the pyWWT
          package and WWT. In this example we assume you are using pyWWT on
          the same Windows machine where you are running WorldWide Telescope.
          You can also run the python package on a different machine running
          Linux or MacOS and connect to WWT on the remote Windows machine over
          the network.</p>

          <p>
            There is good documentation on installation and usage of pyWWT on
            the project website -
            <a href="http://www.jzuhone.com/pywwt/index.html">http://www.jzuhone.com/pywwt/index.html</a>.
            Below we take through one specific path, which will be useful if
            you are new to Python.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1 - Installing Python (Anaconda)</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                First download the Anaconda Python distribution
                <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a>.
                You don&rsquo;t have to use this distribution, but
                instructions on adding the packages that pyWWT depends on will
                be specific to Anaconda. Note, you will have to provide an
                email to get to the download page. When you install the
                distribution, it is easier to install it for &ldquo;Just
                Me&rdquo;, rather than for &ldquo;All Users.&rdquo;
              </p>

              <p>Anaconda Python this includes most of the packages that are
              needed by pyWWT. If you are using another Python distribution,
              you will have to make sure the following are installed:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>NumPy</li>
                <li>Matplotlib</li>
                <li>AstroPy</li>
                <li>Beautiful Soup 4</li>
                <li>Requests</li>
                <li>Dateutil</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              The only extra package you need to install is astroquery. First
              download and git -
              <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win">http://git-scm.com/download/win</a>.
              Run the installer and take the defaults until the page on
              &ldquo;Adjusting your PATH environment.&rdquo; On that page,
              select &ldquo;Use Git from the Window Command Prompt.&rdquo;
              <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Git Installer.jpg" alt="Git
              Installer PATH step" class="img-responsive img-border" />
            </li>

            <li>Now open the &ldquo;Anaconda Command Prompt,&rdquo; accessible
            through Windows Start Menu. Note, if you installed Anaconda for
            All Users, you have to run the command prompt as
            administrator.</li>

            <li>
              Install astroquery package: <br />
              <code>&gt; pip install
              git+http://github.com/astropy/astroquery.git#egg=astroquery</code>
            </li>

            <li>
              While the Anaconda Command Prompt is open, install pyWWT: <br />
              <code>&gt; pip install pywwt</code>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Running IPython Notebook</h3>

          <p>Mark SubbaRao created an IPython Notebook to import and visualize
          extragalactic datasets.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              First download the Notebook
              <a href="@Model.ContentDir/learn/Visualizing Extragalactic Data
              in WWT.ipynb">here</a>.
            </li>

            <li>If it is not open already startup the &ldquo;Anaconda Command
            Prompt.&rdquo;</li>

            <li>
              Open up the Notebook viewer in a web browser: <br />
              <code>&gt;ipython notebook</code>
            </li>

            <li>
              Import the downloaded Notebook by either dragging the
              &ldquo;Visualizing Extragalactic Data in WWT.ipynb&rdquo; file
              to the IPython Notebook viewer or clicking &ldquo;
              <strong>click here</strong>&rdquo; at the top and navigate to
              the file. <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Importing Notebook.jpg"
              alt="Importing Notebook" class="img-responsive img-border" />
            </li>

            <li>After importing it click the blue &ldquo;Upload&rdquo;
            button.</li>

            <li>Click on the Notebook title. This should open up the Notebook
            in a separate tab. The Notebook is made up of a series of cells,
            which can have various types of information, including code. The
            current cell is indicated.</li>

            <li>
              Click the &ldquo;Run Cell&rdquo; button, which will move past
              the first text cell to the first part of code
              &ldquo;In[1]&rdquo; <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Controlling
              Notebook.jpg" alt="Controlling Notebook" class="img-responsive
              img-border" />
            </li>

            <li>When you get to the &ldquo;In[2], which Acquires Data from
            GAMA database a status bar at the bottom of the cell will show the
            progress of downloading the database (2.6MB). Wait for the file to
            finish downloading and then run the next cell.</li>

            <li>Before connecting to WWT using LCAPI, startup WorldWide
            Telescope. In this example, we are running on the same machine. If
            this is not the case, you can start it on the remote machine and
            then give the IP address of the WWT machine in In[4].</li>

            <li>When you execute In[5], you will see a new &ldquo;GAMA
            Galaxies&rdquo; layer appear in the Layer Manager.</li>

            <li>You can view this in SolarSystem mode and fly out to see the
            new dataset as well as the SDSS Galaxies shipped with WWT. Note,
            in the Layer Manger SDSS galaxies are called &ldquo;Cosmos (SDSS
            Galaxies)&rdquo;.</li>

            <li>You can also switch to Sky mode and then right-click on the
            &ldquo;GAMA Galaxies&rdquo; layer and bring up the properties
            dialog box. In the Scale tab, use the slider to set Scale Factor
            to 16. In the Markers tab, select the &ldquo;Marker Type&rdquo; to
            be &ldquo;Circle.&rdquo; Then when you view the patch of sky where
            the GAMA galaxies are found and zoom in you will see the positions
            marked as circles.</li>

          <p>Panoramas are wide field of view images taken with either
          wide-angle fish-eye lenses or stitched together from individual
          images take of a wide field of view scene.</p>

          <p>This tutorial will walk through how to process these data so that
          they can be TOAST projected into a multi-resolution format that can
          be hosted in the Cloud.</p>

          <p><strong>If you have a collection of images</strong>.</p>

          <p>Many high resolution panoramas, especially ones obtained by
          remote space craft, are taken as a collection of individual
          images.&nbsp; In the case where you have a collection the first step
          is to stitch them together to create a single panorama image that
          can be processed for WWT (see below).</p>

          <p>There are several programs that</p>

          </ol>

          <p>This tutorial uses Image Composite Editor (ICE).</p>

          <p>Collect the images that cover as much of your field of view as
          possible. They do not need to be in any specific order or have any
          naming convention.&nbsp;</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Startup ICE.</li>
            <li>Click "New Panorama From Images".</li>
            <li>Navigate to the folder with the images. Assuming the folder
            had only the images to be stitched together, click Control-A to
            select all the images and then click "Open".</li>
            <li>Under "Camera Motion" in the upper right, make sure
            "Auto-detect" is clicked.</li>
            <li>At the upper menu, click "Stitch".</li>
            <li>When it is finished it will show the images stitched together
            and projected. Leave the projection as "Cylindrical".&nbsp;</li>
            <li>In the upper menu, click "Crop". You should probably not apply
            any crops.</li>
            <li>In the upper menu, click "Export". In the upper right don’t
            change any of the parameters, and click "Export to
            disk&hellip;"</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>If you have a panoramic image already.</strong></p>

          <p>Many cameras can obtain panoramic images directly. Examples are
          Ricoh Theta - <a target="external" href="https://theta360.com/en/">https://theta360.com/en/</a> and
          Kodak Pixpro - <a target="external"
          href="http://kodakpixpro.com/Americas/cameras/actioncamera/sp360.php">http://kodakpixpro.com/Americas/cameras/actioncamera/sp360.php</a>
          cameras.&nbsp; Even smart phones can capture panoramic images with
          software such as Microsoft’s Photosynth - <a target="external"
          href="https://photosynth.net/">https://photosynth.net/</a> of the
          built-in camera app on iOS.&nbsp; This could be useful in capturing
          panoramic views of observatories or observational locations.&nbsp;
          Of course another important type of data are panoramic views of
          surfaces of other bodies of the Solar System.&nbsp; However the
          panoramic image was obtained, this image is the input to the next
          step, which is to use the SphereToaster tool.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Open the panorama and make sure that it is of the correct size.
              The input panorama file should be in equi-rectangular (aka
              cylindrical equidistant) projection.&nbsp; In this projection
              the panorama should be twice as wide as it is tall and should
              cover the entire 360 field of view.&nbsp; If the image is
              projected correctly but isn’t the entire size, I recommend that
              you pad the image with black space.&nbsp; In this example, we
              will use a free Windows program called Irfanview
              (<a target="external"
              href="http://www.irfanview.com/">http://www.irfanview.com/</a>).&nbsp;
              You can open the image and the image dimensions are shown in the
              lower left corner.&nbsp; In this example, the image is 7872 x
              1752 pixels.&nbsp;

              <br />
              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12967831/adecb7c6-d02f-11e5-97c7-7e484d9a4e87.jpg" class="img-responsive img-border" alt="Irfanview1" title="click to view full size">
            </li>

            <li>
              If you need to pad the image to be 2:1 then in Irfanview, under
              the Image menu, select "Change canvas size". In this example,
              the width of the image is 360 degrees but it covers the middle
              part and does not go to the top and bottom. Given that the width
              is 7872 the final height should be half that or 3936
              pixels.&nbsp; Since the image is actually 1752 pixels high we
              have to pad 3936-1752=2184 pixels.&nbsp; This padding needs to
              be split equally to be added to the top and bottom; that is,
              1092 to top and bottom and 0 to left and right.

              <br />
              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12967832/adee49ce-d02f-11e5-8a08-1c7811e427a8.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </li>

            <li>Then save the image and it should now have the dimensions 7872
            x 2936.</li>

            <li>Download the WWT SDK, available here: On the Tools
            page: <a href="//worldwidetelescope.org/Download/Tools">//worldwidetelescope.org/Download/Tools</a>
            click on "SDK with data pipeline and original ADK tools" which
            should link
            to: <a href="http://wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/drops/WWTSDK.msi">http://wwtweb.blob.core.windows.net/drops/WWTSDK.msi</a>.</li>

            <li>Install the SDK. It will install a folder: C:\Program Files
            (x86)\Microsoft Research\WorldWide Telescope SDK.&nbsp; Go into
            that folder and then into "Sphere Toaster" and then execute the
            program: "SphereToaster.exe".</li>

            <li>
              In SphereToaster start with the "Input" tab. Click "Open" and
              navigate to the padded image in equi-rectangular
              projection.&nbsp; Assuming you did your padding correctly, you
              should not have to change anything.<br />

              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12967829/adec5a1a-d02f-11e5-9183-266d27b603f8.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </li>

            <li>Under the Output tab, select a folder where the processed
            files will be created. Note, that the total size of the processed
            data can be much more than the original, especially if the input
            image is compressed with much black, so make sure the output drive
            has sufficient space.&nbsp; The default Project Name is taken from
            the input file name, which you can change.&nbsp; This is the name
            of the output WTML file.</li>

            <li>Under Type, choose "Panorama". In order to preserve
            transparency, keep the output format as PNG and do not select
            JPEG.</li>

            <li>
              Since you have padded the image in the previous step, under
              "Fill Option" select "No fill". <br />
              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12967830/adec5dd0-d02f-11e5-8b38-e9aaffe1001f.jpg"
              class="img-responsive" />
            </li>

            <li>
              Under the WTML tab, you can give the descriptive information for
              the image.&nbsp; Under Title, you should give a descriptive (and
              short) title that will show up in WWT.&nbsp; Under Credits, you
              can put the caption information, including the credit to the
              person or organization who owns the copyright of the
              image.&nbsp; You can specify the URL (Credits URL) which points
              to web page that described the image or data.&nbsp; Assuming you
              are going to make this panorama available on-line you can
              specify the URL to the web server that will serve the panorama
              data (Storage URL).&nbsp; Note this can be changed easily if you
              don&rsquo;t set this now or change the location of the server
              later. <br />
              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12967828/adec3a4e-d02f-11e5-98e9-957b082eb8fd.jpg"
              class="img-responsive" />
            </li>

            <li>When you are finished entering this metadata, go back to the
            Output tab and click on: "Generate Pyramid + WTML".&nbsp; This
            will take a while.&nbsp; For this example (7,872 x 3,936) it took
            about 40 minutes on a reasonably fast PC.&nbsp; Note, that while
            it is working the GUI doesn't get updated and the window banner
            will show "WWT SphereToaster (Alpha) (Not Responding."&nbsp; It is
            actually running so don&rsquo;t close the window. It will report
            some progress in the Messages window in the lower right of the
            Output tab.&nbsp; When you first load the image it will report
            that it found the input image (&ldquo;Loaded
            C:\Users\docto\Downloads\Chang&rsquo;e 3.jpg&rdquo; in this
            example).&nbsp; You can check on it with the task manager or by
            looking at the properties of the output folder; the total output
            size should be increasing as the process runs and generates more
            files.&nbsp; When it is finished SphereToaster will report the
            number of tiles created and time to process the data.</li>

            <li>
              When this is complete, the process will create the following:
              <ul>
                <li>Folder full of tiles, e.g., &ldquo;Chang&rsquo;e
                3&rdquo;</li>
                <li>WTML file to use locally, &ldquo;Chang&rsquo;e
                3LOCAL.wtml&rdquo;. This is only used for local testing and
                cannot be shared outside the machine you are working on.</li>
                <li>WTML file to use when the data are on a web server,
                &ldquo;Chang&rsquo;e 3.wtml&rdquo;. Once the data are
                processed and moved to the specified server, sharing this file
                will provide access to it.</li>
                <li>Thumbnail; the name is a lower case version of the title
                with spaces replaced with underscores (e.g.,,
                &ldquo;chang&rsquo;e_3.jpg&rdquo;)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>You can view the generated panorama by starting WorldWide
            Telescope and then double-clicking on the local version of the
            WTML file. In this example it is "Chang'e 3LOCAL.wtml".&nbsp;
            Note, that this points to the specific location on disk where you
            specified the output, so if you move that folder you have to edit
            this local WTML file.</li>

            <li>The other version of the WTML file (Chang'e 3.wtml) is setup
            to point to a data on a web server. In the WTML file, you should
            review the location of (Url="[Storage Url]/Chang'e 3
            Pano/{1}/{3}/{3}_{2}.jpg", &ldquo;Storage URL&rdquo; was specified
            in the WTML tab).&nbsp; After the image pyramid is created, you
            can move it to the web server and then use the
            &ldquo;Chang&rsquo;e 3.wtml&rdquo; to access the data over the
            web. If you move the data to a different web server, you need to
            change the server address in the Url tag in the WTML file.</li>

              this example), see below. <br />
              <img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9676722/12994469/93838470-d0e6-11e5-9bd4-c157c2e06c1d.jpg"

            </li>

            <li>
              When this is complete, the process will create the following
              <ul>
                <li>Folder full of tiles, g., &ldquo;Milky Way CO&rdquo;</li>
                <li>WTML file to use locally, &ldquo;Milky Way
                COLOCAL.wtml&rdquo;. This is only used for local testing and
                cannot be shared outside the machine you are working on.</li>
                <li>WTML file to use when the data are on a web server,
                &ldquo;Milky Way CO.wtml&rdquo;. Once the data are processed
                and moved to the specified server, sharing this file will
                provide access to it.</li>
                <li>Thumbnail; the name is a lower case version of the title
                with spaces replaced with underscores (e.g.,,
                &ldquo;milky_way_co.jpg&rdquo;)</li>
              </ul>

            <li>You can view the generated all-sky image by starting WorldWide
            Telescope and then double-clicking on the local version of the
            WTML file. In this example it is "Milky Way COLOCAL.wtml".&nbsp;
            Note, that this points to the specific location on disk where you
            specified the output, so if you move that folder you have to edit
            this local WTML file.</li>

            <li>The other version of the WTML file without appended
            &ldquo;LOCAL&rdquo; (in this example, &ldquo;Milky Way
            CO.wtml&rdquo;) is setup to point to a data on a web server. In
            the WTML file, you should review the location of (Url="[Storage
            URL]/Milky Way CO/{1}/{3}/{3}_{2}.jpg", &ldquo;Storage URL&rdquo;
            was specified in the WTML tab).&nbsp; After the image pyramid is
            created, you can move it to the web server and then use the
            &ldquo;Milky Way CO.wtml&rdquo; to access the data over the web.
            If you move the data to a different web server, you need to change
            the server address in the Url tag in the WTML file.</li>
