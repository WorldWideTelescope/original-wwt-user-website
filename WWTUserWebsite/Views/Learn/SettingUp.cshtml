	<h4>Overview</h4>

	<p>WorldWide Telescope can be launched in a Kiosk mode, which is
	  designed for unfacilitated use in museums or other informal learning
	  environments. There are two general ways this can be done. One is to
	  show a narrative presentation in the form of a tour. The other mode is
	  to allow free exploration. </p>

	<p>Unless you go to great lengths to harden your kiosk computer by
	  installing software to intercept certain windows keyboard commands,
	  you should not have a publically-accessible keyboard connected. A
	  connected keyboard gives the user the ability to Control-Alt-Delete to
	  get task manager, which could break out of WWT and give access to the
	  computer. For administration purposes, museum staff will want to be
	  able to connect a keyboard or remote desktop to the computer to do
	  this.</p>

	<h4>Kiosk Tour</h4>

	<ol>
	  <li>Create the tour in WWT. Save it to a file at a folder on your
	    PC.</li>

	  <li>On the last slide of your tour Right-click and choose “Set Next
	    Slide.” This will bring up a dialog box click the first slide of the
	    tour. Clicking the slide will also check the box “Link to Slide
	    (Selected below).” Click Ok.</li>

	  <li>Create a shortcut.
	    <ol type="a">
	      <li>Right-click at the location you want the shortcut to live
	        and select “New/Shortcut”</li>
	      <li>This will open a dialog box to type the location of the
	        item. You can browse to the WWT install or if it is a standard
	        installation, you can enter "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
	        Research\Microsoft WorldWide Telescope\WWTExplorer.exe". Don’t
	        forget that the entire path should be enclosed in double
	        quotes.</li>
	      <li>Following the location for WWTExplorer.exe (which is the WWT
	        application), you should put the location of the Kiosk Tour you
	        created in the first step. In this example, the tour (named
	        “Kiosk Tour.wtt”) is on the desktop for the user named Exhibit
	        and the full path to the tour "C:\Users\Exhibit\Desktop\Kiosk
	        Tour.wtt”.</li>
	      <li>Following the path to the tour, put the flag that puts the
	        application into the kiosk mode “-kiosk”.</li>
	      <li>For the above example, the entire entry for the location of
	        the item would be: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
	        Research\Microsoft WorldWide Telescope\WWTExplorer.exe"
	        "C:\Users\Exhibit\Desktop\Kiosk Tour.wtt” -kiosk. When you are
	        finished you might want to change the name of the shortcut to
	        something relating to the tour, such as “Run Cool WWT Kiosk
	        Tour,” otherwise it will default to the name
	        “WWTExplorer.exe”.</li>
	      <li>You can always change this by right-clicking on the shortcut
	        and selecting “Properties”. In the dialog box that comes up you
	        can edit the Target field.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	</ol>

	<h4>Interactive Kiosk Tour</h4>

	<p>In all cases you should consider what interaction you want with the
	  public to have with WWT. Possibilities are:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Mouse/trackball</li>
	  <li>Xbox controller</li>
	  <li>Touch screen</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Auto-start the Tour on Startup</h4>

	<ol>
	  <li>Setup auto-login for user running WWT.</li>
	  <li>Setup shortcut to be executed on login</li>
	  <li>Links to tools for timed startup and shutdown.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>WorldWide Telescope can be used to produce and deliver experiences
	  for planetarium domes. WWT is currently being used at several
	  planetaria, from small inflatable domes all the way to large domes,
	  such as the 20-projector Grainger Sky Theater at the Adler Planetarium
	  in Chicago. In addition to multi-projector domes, WWT can be used to
	  drive multiple monitor systems for flat or curved large format tiled
	  displays. WWT has built-in support for coordinating multiple servers
	  as well as the warps and blends necessary to create the correct
	  projection for specific display layouts. </p>

      <div class="panel-body">
	<p>Currently, WorldWide Telescope (WWT) can be controlled by a variety
	  of controllers. Custom mapping can be done for MIDI and Xbox
	  controllers, connected by USB to the computer running WWT as well as
	  configurable virtual buttons.</p>

	<h4>MIDI Controller</h4>

	<p>Any MIDI controller can be used to control WorldWide Telescope. You
	  can re-use mapping of WWT functions created by someone else. You can
	  also create your own or edit a previously-created mapping. Start by
	  selecting “Settings/Controller Setup...” This brings up a dialog
	  window where you can select a file containing the mapping functions.
	  For the Numark DJ2Go you
	  can <a href="@Model.ContentDir/learn/Numark%20DJ2Go.wwtmm">download a
	    standard mapping file</a>.</p>

	<img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/numark_djtogo.jpg" alt="Numark DJ2Go"
	     class="img-responsive img-border" />

	<p>You can save and load different files with different mappings.</p>

	<p>Highlighting a device in the list of MIDI devices on the left and
	  clicking “Properties” below will bring up the Controller Properties
	  window that presents the status of the controller and location to the
	  image file used for mapping. Note, that this image can be specified as
	  a URL, such as</p>

	<p>@Model.ImgDir/learn/numark_djtogo.jpg</p>

	<p>or it can point to a local file, such as </p>

	<p>\Documents\MIDI\numarkdj2go.png.</p>

	<p>To remove an existing binding, select it in the list and click the
	  “-” button. A box will come up to ask you to confirm the removal of
	  the control.</p>

	<p>To remove an existing binding, select it in the list and click the
	  “-” button. A box will come up to ask you to confirm the removal of
	  the control.</p>

	<p>To add a new binding, click the “+” button. This will bring up a
	  box saying that WorldWide Telescope is listening to the controller
	  waiting for you to manipulate a control that has not been previously
	  mapped. When such a control is moved, it will ask for the control
	  type; select one of: </p>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>KeyPress </strong> &mdash; detects that a key has been
	    pressed and does some action.</li>
	  <li><strong>KeyUpDown</strong> &mdash; this sets up two actions, one
	    when the key goes from Down to Up and the other from Up to Down.
	    These can be defined separately.</li>
	  <li><strong>Slider</strong> &mdash; linear slider from one value to
	    another</li>
	  <li><strong>Knob</strong> &mdash; rotating know from one value to
	    another</li>
	  <li><strong>Jog</strong> &mdash; jog dial that can be move spun
	    repeatedly, often used in advancing time</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Once you have selected the control type it will be added to the
	  list of control bindings with the Control Name the same is the ID
	  number. You can then define what you want to happen when you
	  manipulate the control. When you select a control binding the
	  properties are shown below the list and you can change or set the
	  following properties:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Binding Target Type pull-down </strong> &mdash;
	    Categories of actions that can be sent to WWT.</li>
	  <li><strong>Bind Type pull-down </strong> &mdash; Ways to bind the
	    controller to WWT.</li>
	  <li><strong>Property pull-down </strong> &mdash; Specific properties
	    controlled.</li>
	  <li><strong>Repeat checkbox </strong> &mdash; If this is checked,
	    holding down will continuously send the same command. This makes
	    sense for actions like zooming.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A full list of potential bindings is available in an Excel
	  spreadsheet <a href="@Model.ContentDir/learn/Binding%20Properties.xlsx">here</a>.</p>

	<p>The labels for the functions can be placed on the position of the
	  corresponding knob on the image for the controller. In the case of the
	  default map this has already been done. Click the function in the list
	  and hold and drag onto the image. Release your mouse when the label is
	  at the desired location. Note that when the “Monitor” box is checked
	  and the key is pressed on the controller the label changes from white
	  to yellow.
        </p>

	<h4>Xbox Controller</h4>

	<p>WWT can be controlled by a PC version of an Xbox Controller. This
	  is an excellent interface to use in a planetarium or presentation
	  environment because the controller is portable and the buttons can be
	  distinguished in the dark.</p>

	<p>WWT comes with a standard binding of functions. This default is for
	  the left/right triggers to zoom out/in. The right bumper steps through
	  objects in the context menu (at the bottom of WWT screen). The left
	  thumbstick pan and scroll and the right thumbstick rotates the view.
	  The Back key steps backwards and the Start key steps forwards through
	  LookAt modes (Sky, Earth, SolarSystem etc.). The ABXY keys are defined
	  in the table below.</p>

	<table class="table">
	  <thead>
	    <tr>
	      <th>&nbsp;</th>
	      <th>Look At Earth</th>
	      <th>Look At Sky</th>
	      <th>Look At Solar System</th>
	    </tr>
	  </thead>
	  <tbody>
	    <tr>
	      <td><strong>A</strong></td>
	      <td>&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>Equatorial Grid</td>
	      <td>Asteroids</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td><strong>B</strong></td>
	      <td>&nbsp;</td>
	      <td>Constellation Boundaries</td>
	      <td>Milky Way Model</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td><strong>X</strong></td>
	      <td>Clouds</td>
	      <td>Ecliptic Overview</td>
	      <td>Planetary Orbits</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	      <td><strong>Y</strong></td>
	      <td>Clouds</td>
	      <td>Constellation Figures</td>
	      <td>3D Stars</td>
	    </tr>
	  </tbody>
	</table>

	<p>Default mappings appropriate for print or reference is
	  available <a href="@Model.ContentDir/learn/Xbox%20Controller%20Mapping.pdf">here</a>.</p>

	<p>In order to define your own settings select “Settings/Xbox
	  Controller Setup...” This brings up a dialog window where you can
	  select a file containing the mapping functions. Check the “Use Custom
	  Mappings” box and you can see the default mapping and change any of
	  them. You can control the properties in the same way as the MIDI
	  controller, described above. Checking the “Use Mode Dependent
	  Mappings” allows a different mapping to be used depending on the
	  mode.</p>

	<p>A full list of potential bindings is available in an Excel
	  spreadsheet <a href="@Model.ContentDir/learn/Binding%20Properties.xlsx">here</a>.</p>

	<p>You can save, load and share custom mappings files (extension
	  .wwtxm) from this dialog box.</p>

	<h4>Virtual Buttons</h4>

	<p>Clicking the View button will show the View controls at the top of
	  the WWT window. The blank area to the right of the control –
	  identified by the green box in the image below – is a place where you
	  can define and place custom virtual buttons. These buttons can have
	  the same bindings as the MIDI and Xbox controllers. </p>

	<img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/virtual_buttons.jpg" alt="Numark DJ2Go"
	     class="img-responsive img-border" data-coords="550,3"/>

	<p>Clicking the “+” key brings up a binding dialog box. You can give
	  the button a “Name,” select “Button Type,” “Binding Target Type,”
	  “Bind Type,” and “Property,” just like the MIDI controller, described
	  above.</p>

	<p>In the example above I have defined a Longitude and Latitude
	  slider. Clicking the “E” enters an editing mode for the buttons. When
	  in edit mode, you can rearrange the buttons. Right clicking on a
	  button will allow you to toggle the button editing mode, change the
	  binding properties or delete a virtual button.</p>

	  Tweaking Performance

      <div class="panel-body">
	<h5>Evaluating Performance</h5>

	<p>WorldWide Telescope can show many layers and types of data, but
	  various things can affect visual performance, both interactivity and
	  during playback. A rule of thumb is that a modern PC with a dedicated
	  graphics card will likely perform fine for most installations. But
	  older machines or modern ones that have integrated graphics might not
	  be adequate for the most accurate rendering. The most immediate way to
	  evaluate performance is to show the frame rate. This can be done by
	  selecting: <strong>Settings/Advanced/Show Performance
	    Data</strong>.</p>

	<p>When this is selected, WorldWide Telescope displays the frames per
	  second (FPS) along with other information about loaded data in the
	  title bar of the main WWT window.</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive img-border"
	        src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Performance Data.jpg" alt="Perforamnce data"
	        /></p>

	<p>For cluster and dome installations, WWT can also report this frame
	  rate for all projector servers in a GUI on the master. To show this
	  GUI, select <strong>Settings/Advanced/Projector Server List</strong>.
	  This GUI shows the status of each projector server. This example has a
	  single projection server (Pluto) and shows whether the computer is on
	  the network (Online), if WWT is running (Ready), the IP for the
	  projection server (192.168.0.110) and the frame rate for that
	  projector (20.5 FPS).</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive img-border"
	        src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Projector Server List.jpg" alt="Server List"
	        /></p>

	<p>The frame rate could be capped by the WWT itself – see below –
	  otherwise WWT tries to draw as a new frame as fast as it can and the
	  effective frame rate is shown in the window. Frame rates of less than
	  30 will introduce noticeable stuttering and numbers of less than 15
	  FPS will be very distracting. Note that for simple scenes and fast
	  hardware the FPS could be a large number – hundreds – much larger in
	  fact than the ability of a projector or monitor to display it.</p>

	<h3>Optimizing Performance</h3>

	<p>All visualization programs trade off visual fidelity with rendering
	  time. When you are using WWT to run a live program usually you want to
	  trade off fidelity with rendering time. In fast moving scenes where it
	  may be hard to keep up visually without having very low frame rates,
	  the human perception of fidelity is limited. So usually, you want to
	  do what you can to keep FPS to 30 or above and compromise on rendering
	  quality if necessary.</p>

	<p>For interactive and playback uses, you can change the following
	  settings to try to improve the performance. </p>

	<h5>Anti-aliasing</h5>

	<p>Antialiasing is a graphics technique to redraw lines and edges with
	  to avoid showing them as jagged lines made up of individual pixels.
	  Modern graphics cards can usually handle this easily. However, most
	  integrated graphics can’t do this and thus those calculations are done
	  by the CPU not the GPU, resulting in very poor performance. The first
	  step in improving performance is turning off anti-aliasing. Open the
	  menu <strong>View/Multi-Sample Antialiasing</strong> and
	  select <strong>None</strong>. Note, changing this value will require a
	  restart of WWT to take effect. When you have restarted play the tour
	  again and look at the FPS and see if that has improved the frame rate
	  adequately.</p>

	<p><img class="img-responsive img-border"
	        src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/Anti-Aliasing.jpg" alt="anti-aliasing" /></p>

	<h5>Content</h5>

	<p>The frame rate depends on the scene as well as the performance of
	  the graphics hardware. Within the constraints of the graphics hardware
	  the only other thing you can change is the content. The most difficult
	  content to render is 3D content: terrains of planetary surfaces, 3D
	  models, or 3D cities. Content affects performance in two stages. The
	  first stage is data loading. Running the tour through will load the
	  data onto your local disk cache. This is the first step, but final
	  performance depends on how quickly you can get the data into the
	  computer’s GPU. When you play the tour if the data is being drawn as
	  you move through a scene then you want to make sure that data loading
	  is done before the audience sees it. The easiest way to do this is add
	  the have the first 1-2 seconds of the scene rendered while the display
	  is faded to black. Then fade up from black and most of the data will
	  have been loaded for the scene.</p>

	<ol>
	  <li>In the lower part of the layer manager, right-click
	    on <strong>Dome/Overlays/Fade to black</strong> and
	    select <strong>Add to Timeline</strong>. Unless the Tour will only
	    be shown in a dome environment, make sure the <strong>Fade Dome
	      Only</strong> under <strong>Fade to black</strong> is <em>not</em>
	    checked.</li>
	  <li>In the Timeline editor make a key
	    for <strong>FadeToBlack</strong> at start time 00:00 and set the
	    Opacity, which is the only sub-property, to 1, which means it is
	    faded to black. If the timeline editor is not shown, you can expose
	    it be selecting <strong>Show Timeline Editor</strong> under
	    the <strong>Guided Tours</strong> tab.</li>
	  <li>Then move the time slider to 2 seconds into the slide and make
	    another <strong>FadeToBlack</strong> key and set it to 1 as
	    well. </li>
	  <li>Make a third <strong>FadeToBlack</strong> key 1 second following
	    the second key (at 3 seconds) and set that value to 0. </li>
	  <li>Play the slide and it should be black for the first 2 seconds,
	    and hopefully that is enough time to load the necessary data. Then
	    between 2 and 3 seconds the scene should fade in from black.</li>
	  <li>6. Adjust the time locations of the keys to keep it black for
	    long enough to hide the data loading if the suggested times are not
	    sufficient.</li>
	</ol>

	<h5>Target Frame Rate</h5>

	<p>WWT attempts to render frames as fast as the GPU can make them.
	  This results in the GPU being pushed hard and will cause it to consume
	  more power and heat up. If the GPU overheats, it can scale back its
	  performance or shut down completely. In real-world environments, the
	  projectors and monitors only operate at a certain refresh rate and
	  rendering more frames per second isn’t necessary. You can set the
	  limit on the frame rate in the menu View/Target Frame Rate. In most
	  cases you want to choose 60 or 30 FPS.</p>

	<h3>Rendering to Video</h3>

	<p>Interactive performance requires WWT to render the scene every
	  frame, every 1/30 of a second. For playback that doesn’t require
	  interactivity – for instance in a planetarium system – one way to deal
	  with performance issues it to render the tour to a video for playback.
	  That way, WWT can take as much time as it needs to render a frame
	  including fetching the data, putting the scene together and finally
	  rendering. To do this, load the desired tour. Then under the open
	  the <strong>Render Tour to Video</strong> dialog box
	  under <strong>Guided Tours/Render to Video</strong>. Then make sure
	  the “Wait for all downloads” is checked before rendering. More details
	  on rendering to video are
	  available <a href="/Learn/Authoring#rendertovideo">here</a>.</p>

	<h4>Overview</h4>

	<p>WorldWide Telescope (WWT) is a great tool with access to Petabytes
	  of image data from the cloud, but in some educational contexts the
	  internet may not be available but it is desirable to use WWT as a tool
	  on a stand-alone basis. WorldWide Telescope already can operate
	  off-line when the internet is available, and browse any data
	  previously viewed by that user on that machine. In a new installation,
	  there is no cache history for a user to rely on and the experience is
	  not acceptable.</p>

	<p>To solve this issue we have created a tool that will allow for the
	  creation of curated cache content that would be installed from a DVD
	  or thumb drive along with the WWT client to allow a disconnected or
	  poorly connected machine to run most of WWT features without ever
	  having to connect to the internet.</p>

	<h4>Tools</h4>

	<p>WWT already has existing tools for basic cache management. With the
	  Eclipse release WWT adds several new tools to help curate the cache
	  contents. This is a combined list of both the new and old tools.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Cache measurement/purge utility in the Settings tab</li>
	  <li>Cache Management Menu from Right click menu item in
	    explore/context tabs.
	    <ul>
	      <li>Cache Image Tile Pyramid</li>
	      <li>Show Cache Space Used </li>
	      <li>Remove from Image Cache</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Playing a tour caches all data it views.</li>
	  <li>Playing tours with “Play all” option will play and repeat tours
	    in a collection</li>
	  <li>Browsing collections will add images you view to the cache.</li>
	  <li>Play collection as slideshow will go from image to image and
	    cache data as it goes.</li>
	  <li>Editing the cache directory manually thru Windows explorer.
	    <ul>
	      <li>C:\Users\{user name
	        here}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WorldWideTelescope</li>

	    </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Setting up WMS servers, and caching data they use.</li>
	  <li>Running WWT in Solar System mode with Multi-Resolution planets
	    will load in base maps need for that mode.</li>
	  <li>Save the Cache in Settings…Advanced..Save Cache as Cabinet
	    File…</li>
	  <li>Load the Cache in Settings…Advances…Restore Cache from Cabinet
	    File…</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Process</h4>

	<ol>
	  <li>Ensure your WWT instance has a fresh, clean cache.</li>
	  <li>Use the cache tools to load data you thing is important .</li>
	  <li>Measure the cache size as you go budgeting for the data sets you
	    need.</li>
	  <li>Use the UI or manual cache management in Explorer to trim excess
	    if needed.</li>
	  <li>Save The Cache file to a cabinet file.</li>
	  <li>Move the cabinet file to a fresh non-internet connected
	    machine.</li>
	  <li>Install a fresh WWT install.</li>
	  <li>Restore the Cabinet file.</li>
	  <li>Verity operation and note any missing data.</li>
	  <li>Repeat the above steps as necessary until the cache meets the
	    educational requirements.</li>

	<h4>Deployment</h4>

	<p>In the final Eclipse release the setup will detect the presence of
	  a cache cabinet file and offer to install it automatically. This file
	  should be named “WwtFileCache.cabinet” and be placed next to the
	  WWTSetup.5.x.x.msi file. After installation WWT will use this cache
	  transparently as if it actually visited all the data already.</p>

	  WorldWide Telescope (WWT) can playback an SMPTE timing track to
	  provide timing control of off-board audio or other SMPTE-controller
	  effects. SMPTE provides a flexible, easy-to-implement control
	  solution; this flexibility makes it possible to setup things in
	  various ways. This document will provide a description of two
	  potential scenarios, but more can be created if these don’t map to
	  your facility.
	</p>

	<h5>Simple Audio Using Embedded Audio File in WWT Tour</h5>

	<p>
	  The easiest way to setup a system is for the Master Server to output
	  audio, via analog or digital audio output. The mono or stereo audio
	  tracks are created for narration and music on per-slide or
	  Master-slide basis in the tour – see LINK: Authoring/Dealing with
	  Audio and LINK: Authoring/Editing Audio. Then direct connections
	  between the Master Server and hardware sound system (amplifiers and
	  speakers) takes care of the audio. This is a simple case with few
	  pieces, but is limited by the number of audio channels and
	  potentially the quality of the underlying audio files.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <strong>Note</strong>: For all WWT cluster implementations, Tours
	  that are distributed to Projector Servers have the audio stripped
	  out, to reduce file size and speed updating.
	</p>

	<h5>Multi-Channel Dome with SMPTE-controlled Audio Server</h5>

	<p>
	  At some planetaria, such as the Grainger Sky Theater at the Adler
	  Planetarium, they have a configuration with three types of servers:
	  Master, Projector and Audio.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The Master Server controls any number or Projection Servers over the
	  network via WWT and WWT Remote. These controls include:
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Power control of Projection Servers from Master.</li>
	  <li>Updating Tour and Data from Master to Projection Servers.</li>
	  <li>Synchronization of playback on multiple Projection Servers.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  For audio, audio tracks (mono, stereo or multi-channel) are loaded
	  onto a dedicated Audio Server. On the WWT Master Server the normal
	  audio track is replaced with a SMPTE timing track. This is usually
	  done with a short-duration slide at the beginning of the tour that
	  is a master and has the SMPTE track as MP3 or WAV format. The analog
	  audio output of the Master Server is connected to an input port on
	  the Audio Server. Once the appropriate audio track(s) are loaded on
	  the Audio Server and the Audio Server is setup to be controlled by
	  input SMPTE timing from Master (via analog audio connections), the
	  audio and video are synchronized via the Master Server.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <strong>Note</strong>: Currently, the timing of WWT cannot be
	  controlled by an external SMPTE source, such as a stand-alone SMPTE
	  generator or Audio Server.

	<p>WorldWide Telescope (WWT) works with Oculus Rift virtual reality
	  headset as a special stereo mode. Note, currently WWT supports Oculus
	  Rift Development Kit 1, (Oculus Rift DK1). You can use this mode by
	  following these steps. </p>

	<ol>
	  <li>Make sure you are running WorldWide Telescope 5.0 or later,
	    which is available
	    here: <a href="/Download/">//worldwidetelescope.org/Download/</a>.</li>
	  <li>Connect the Oculus to the computer.</li>
	  <li>Turn the Oculus on. The Oculus will appear as a secondary
	    monitor. If you look through the Oculus without WWT running you
	    should see a desktop similar to what you see if you connected a
	    secondary monitor.</li>
	  <li>Note, you should try to put the Oculus over your
	    eyeglasses.</li>
	  <li>Start WWT.</li>
	  <li>Enable Oculus Rift mode. Open the menu under View and select
	    Stereo/Oculus Rift. See screenshot below. <br/>
	    <img src="@Model.ImgDir/learn/stereo_oculus.jpg" alt="Enable
	                                                          Oculus Rift mode" class="img-responsive img-border"/>
	  </li>

	  <li>The scene should be visible in the Oculus. Note the menu items
	    are still on the primary display and the main window in the primary
	    will go blank when outputting to Oculus.</li>
	  <li>You can interact with WWT while wearing the headset. Since you
	    can’t see the keyboard and menus, it is easier to use an Xbox or
	    MIDI controller. However, be careful doing fast rotations with the
	    controller, since if the motion is not coordinated with your head
	    rotations, you can induce motion sickness.</li>
	  <li>You can also download and play a tour on asteroid impacts which
	    was created by the WWT team specifically for virtual reality. This
	    tour, called Impacts, and additional information is available
	    here <a href="//worldwidetelescope.org/Planetariums/Impacts">//worldwidetelescope.org/Planetariums/Impacts</a></li>
	  <li>You can create a virtual or physical button
	    (see <a href="/Learn/SettingUp#controllersandbuttons"
	            target="_blank">http://worldwidetelescope.org/Learn/SettingUp#controllersandbuttons</a>)
	    to reset the Oculus Rift view. The function ResetRiftView is under
	    Navigation/Action. This can be useful to set the initial orientation
	    of the virtual environment relative the physical orientation of the
	    Rift.</li>
