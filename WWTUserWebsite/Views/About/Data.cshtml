  <h1 class="text-info">Data in WWT</h1>

  <p>Utilizing a high performance Visual Experience Engine, WorldWide
    Telescope allows you explore the universe as never before. It enables you
    to seamlessly pan the sky and to zoom in on celestial features, including
    stars, nebulae, and planets. For every object, you’ll find multiple
    information sources at your fingertips, just a mouse click away.</p>

  <p>To understand the full power of WWT, bear in mind that celestial objects
    radiate energy over an extremely wide range of wavelengths, from radio waves
    to infrared, optical to ultraviolet, even x-rays and even gamma rays. The
    physical processes inside these objects can only be understood by combining
    observations at several wavelengths, and herein lies the beauty of WWT. It
    brings together many impressive archives of celestial objects – collections
    painstakingly constructed from observations by such instruments as the
    Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the Sloan Digital Sky
    Survey (SDSS), and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS).</p>

  <p>While each of these archives carries interesting and important
    information about the nature of celestial objects, the comprehensive
    analysis of observations requires combining data from multiple instruments
    at different wavelengths. WWT facilitates such analyses, providing free,
    public access to astronomic data from a variety of temporal and
    multi-spectral studies and literature. With WWT, you’ll view the sky from
    multiple wavelengths: See the x-ray view of the sky and zoom into bright
    radiation clouds, then cross-fade into the visible light view and discover
    the cloud remnants of a supernova explosion from a thousand years ago.
    Switch to the hydrogen alpha view to see the distribution and illumination
    of massive primordial hydrogen cloud structures illuminated by high energy
    radiation from nearby stars in the Milky Way. These are just a few of many
    different ways to reveal the hidden structures in the universe with the
    WorldWide Telescope. Pan and zoom from aerial views of the Moon and selected
    plane, and see their precise positions in the sky from any location on Earth
    and any time in the past or future. </p>

  <p>The data in WWT is not only readily accessible; it is presented in a form
    that facilitates integrative research, thereby helping to bridge the gap
    between cutting-edge research, education, and public knowledge. WWT
    represents a major step toward the democratization of science, and it has
    turned the Internet into "the world´s best telescope"—a veritable
    supercomputer at your desktop.</p>

  <h2>The Mars Experience</h2>

  <p>The Mars experience utilizes more than 13,000 high-resolution images
    captured by a number of NASA’s Mars spacecraft, including the Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter. These incredibly detailed images have been
    stitched together and rendered in 3-D by NASA’s Intelligent Robotics
    Group, enabling WWT to create the only pole-to-pole, three-dimensional
    experience of the Red Planet. In addition, the surface map has been color
    corrected to match the latest estimates of the planet’s appearance, adding
    yet more realism to your experience. And to complement your exploration,
    leading astronomers have created interactive guided tours of Mars, so get
    ready for a lifelike experience of the Red Planet. </p>

  <p>Special features as you investigate our planetary neighbor:</p>

  <h3>A True-Color Map of Mars</h3>

  <p>The surface map of Mars has been built and color-corrected to match
    modern estimates of the appearance of Mars. It is made up of images taken
    from a variety of NASA’s Mars spacecraft, including the High-Resolution
    Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on board NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance
    Orbiter. </p>

  <h3>3-D Rendering of the Surface</h3>

  <p>Visitors to the WorldWide Telescope can now have the experience of
    flying though a 3-D rendering of Victoria Crater and Olympus Mons – the
    lowest valley and highest peak in our solar system - and can experience
    firsthand the extreme elevation and intricate features of the Martian
    surface.</p>

  <h3>Exclusive Interactive Tours</h3>

  <p>Microsoft Research has provided a set of exclusive interactive Mars
    tours, including an overview of the WWT Mars experience and Mars’ moons.
    NASA has also published two Mars tours.</p>
