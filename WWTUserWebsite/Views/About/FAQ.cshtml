  <h3><a name=faq1></a>Q. What is WorldWide Telescope?</h3>

  <p>A. The WorldWide Telescope is a rich visualization environment that
  functions as a virtual telescope, bringing together imagery from the best
  ground- and space-based telescopes to enable seamless, guided explorations
  of the universe. WorldWide Telescope, created with Microsoft’s
  high-performance Visual Experience Engine, enables seamless panning and
  zooming across the night sky blending terabytes of images, data and stories
  from multiple sources over the Internet into a media-rich, immersive
  experience. The WorldWide Telescope experience scales from a web browser all
  the way to multi-channel full dome in some of the world's most advanced
  planetariums. </p>

  <h3><a name=faq1.1></a>Q. What is the WorldWide Telescope Web Client?</h3>

  <p>A. The WorldWide Telescope Web Client uses HTML5 to provide a rich
  browser-based version of WorldWide Telescope that that functions as a
  virtual telescope, bringing together imagery from the best ground- and
  space-based telescopes to enable seamless, guided explorations of the
  universe from within a web browser. This version contains a subset of the
  features that the Windows Client offers. Navigate here to learn more about
  the <a href="/About/WebClient">Web Client</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name=faq2></a>Q. What are some of the most compelling features of
  WorldWide Telescope?</h3>

  <p>A. WorldWide Telescope is an observatory on your desktop, allowing you to
  see the sky in a way you have never seen it before through individual
  exploration; multi-wavelength views; stars and planets within context to
  each other; the ability to zoom in and out; and the capability to create,
  search and view guided tours of the universe. You can view the entire solar
  system in 3-D with light and shadows created from the sun, and can explore
  the Earth and Mars in incredible detail. You also can watch planets orbit
  around the sun, and moons orbit around planets. The Visual Experience Engine
  delivers seamless panning and zooming around the night sky, now enhanced
  with the TeraPixel sky image that provides an unmatched panorama of the
  heavens. WorldWide Telescope delivers seamless integration of scientifically
  relevant information, including multi-wavelength, multiple-telescope
  distributed image and data sets, and one-click contextual access to
  distributed Web information and data sources. </p>

  <h3><a name=faq2.1></a>Q. What is unique about the Terapixel sky image?</h3>

  <p>A. The Terapixel sky image is a seamless, high-resolution panorama of the
  night sky. This first of a kind feature provides the largest and
  highest-quality visual image of the sky and was created from data provided
  by the Digitized Sky Survey, a collection of thousands of images taken over
  period of 50 years by two ground-based survey telescopes. When combined and
  processed, the TeraPixel image is a complete, spherical, panoramic rendering
  of the night skies that, if displayed at full size, would require 50,000
  high-definition televisions to view. Using the Project Trident Workflow
  Workbench and the DryadLINQ interface for .NET, Microsoft Researchers
  combined thousands of images and systematically removed differences in
  exposure, brightness, noise floor, and color saturation, and they eliminated
  the “tiling effect” of sharp-edged boundaries between discrete telescopic
  photographs.</p>

  <h3><a name=faq2.2></a>Q. What is WWT | Mars? </h3>

  <p>A. WWT | Mars is an intricate Mars environment map with new,
  high-resolution imagery data that allows for an up-close and personal
  encounter with the Red Planet. These new high quality, high-resolution
  images provide the ability to navigate through space dynamically to make
  your own discoveries. Provided through a collaborative relationship with
  NASA, the WWT | Mars experience includes the most complete pole-to-pole
  coverage of Mars images available allowing WorldWide Telescope users to
  experience Mars in 3-D.</p>

  <h3><a name=faq3></a>Q. Does WorldWide Telescope provide real-time
  data?</h3>

  <p>A. WorldWide Telescope shows you where items are in space today but all
  the images are from different ground- and space-based telescopes, and that
  content is from varying times in the past.</p>

  <h3><a name=faq4></a>What are the system requirements for running WorldWide
  Telescope?</h3>

  <p>Refer to the system requirements section on the <a href="/Download/"> WWT
  Download page</a>.</p>

  <p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>

  <h3><a name=faq5></a>Is WorldWide Telescope available in other
  languages?</h3>

  <p>A. Yes, WorldWide Telescope offers fully-localized user-interfaces for
  Simplified Chinese, German, Russian, Hindi, Spanish and other language
  versions of the Windows Client. To change your language, install the Windows
  Client, then choose the “Select Your Language” option from the Settings
  menu.</p>

  <h3><a name=faq6></a>What is the Microsoft Visual Experience Engine?</h3>

  <p>A. The Microsoft Visual Experience Engine is the technology that enables
  seamless panning and zooming across the night sky, blending terabytes of
  images, data and stories from multiple sources over the Internet into a
  media-rich, immersive experience. </p>

  <p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>

  <h3><a name=faq7></a>Who are some of your partners with WorldWide
  Telescope?</h3>

  <p>A. We are working with a variety of partners in the academic, educational
  and scientific communities to make WorldWide Telescope a success. </p>

  <p><a href=#top>Top</a></p>

  <h3><a name=faq10></a>Is this an extension of Jim Gray’s work?</h3>

  <p>A. Yes. Jim Gray spent his life perfecting database and transaction
  processing systems, and he was committed to using technology to advance
  education. His seminal work on the SkyServer typified his dedication to
  making scientific information and exploration available to specialists and
  laypeople alike, and WWT is an ongoing extension of this work.</p>
