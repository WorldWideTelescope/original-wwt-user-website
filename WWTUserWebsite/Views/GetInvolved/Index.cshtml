        <p>What you can do: You can create a variety of tours with WWT. The
        tour-authoring interface allows tour creators to guide tour viewers
        through the Universe by positioning a virtual camera in various
        slides, and WWT animates the between-slide transitions automatically.
        Tour creators can also add their own images, data, text, music, voice
        over and other media to enhance the message. Buttons, images and other
        elements can link to other Tours, ultimately allowing tour viewers to
        control their own paths.</p> <p>Tour functionality can be used to
        create Kiosks, menu-driven multimedia content, presentations, training
        and quizzing interactives and self-service data exploration. In
        addition to their educational value, tours can be particularly useful
        in collaborative research projects, where researchers can narrate
        and/or annotate various views of data. Tour files are typically small
        enough to be exchanged easily by email or cloud services. Tours that
        follow a linear storyline can also be output to high quality video
        frames for professional quality video production at any resolution
        desired. Tours can also be hosted in a website to create interactive
        web content.</p>

        <p>Skills Required: WWT tours are one of the most powerful aspects of
        WWT, and creating them doesn’t require any programing skills. You
        should know what story you want to tell and understand presentation
        and layout skills. If you can make a PowerPoint presentation then you
        should be able to make a WWT tour.</p>
