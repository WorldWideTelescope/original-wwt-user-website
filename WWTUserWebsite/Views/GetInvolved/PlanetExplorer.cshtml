  <h1>Planet Explorer</h1>

  <p>Explore the planets of our Solar System. Planets fall into two
  categories: gas giants and terrestrial planets. Terrestrial planets are
  rocky with thin atmospheres and include Mercury, Venus, Mars and the Earth.
  The outer four planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are gas giants.
  They are also called Jovian planets, since they all share characteristics
  with Jupiter. Tiny Pluto is the best known dwarf planet; these smaller
  bodies inhabit a region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt beyond
    the orbit of Neptune.</p>

      <h2>Mercury</h2>

      <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is the smallest planet
      of our Solar System. Mercury is a planet of extreme environments; its
      relative close proximity to Sun results in extreme daytime surface
      temperatures of up to 700K (800˚F/427˚C) and cold nighttime temperatures
      around 100K (-280˚F/-173˚C).</p>

      <p>Mercury&rsquo;s eccentric orbit* takes the planet around the Sun
      about every 88 Earth days. Until 2011, we had very little detailed
      information about Mercury, but that is changing with the arrival of the
      spacecraft <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/"
      target="_blank">MESSENGER</a>, a spacecraft designed specifically to
      study Mercury.</p>

      <p>Mercury is basically absent of atmosphere, contributing to the
      extreme temperature gradients found between its equator and poles.
      Mercury&rsquo;s surface is often compared to the surface of our Moon
      with its abundance of craters and fault lines.</p>

      <p><small>* Orbital eccentricity refers to the amount by which an
      object&rsquo;s orbit around another body deviates from a perfect
      circle.</small></p>

      <h2>Venus</h2>

      <p>As the brightest planet in the night sky, Venus has been called both
      the evening star and the morning star!</p>

      <p>Venus&rsquo; orbit around the Sun takes 224 Earth days, but Venus
      takes 243 Earth days to complete a single rotation. In other words,
      Venus rotates so slowly that it completes its journey around the Sun in
      less time than it takes to rotate on its axis.</p>

      <p>Venus has an atmosphere, complete with carbon dioxide and clouds.
      However, its environment is far from welcoming&mdash;the surface-level
      atmospheric pressure of Venus is 92 times that of Earth&rsquo;s and the
      abundance of carbon dioxide in the dense atmosphere creates a greenhouse
      effect that maintains extremely high temperatures of 735K
      (863˚F/462˚C).</p>
    </div>

    <div id="mdlEarth" imgUrl="" imgHover="" credits="">
      <h2>Earth</h2>

      <p>Our planet, Earth, is the third planet from the Sun. Its orbit is
      365.26 days and rotates on its axis approximately every 24 hours (23.934
      hours). Earth is tilted on its axis at 23.45˚ which allows Earth to
      experience our four seasons. During half of the year, the northern
      hemisphere is pointed towards the sun, experiencing summer, while the
      southern hemisphere is pointed away, experiencing winter. Six months
      later, the situation is reversed.</p>

      <p>Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere consists of mostly nitrogen and
      oxygen&mdash;other elements make up the remainder in small percentages.
      The atmosphere protects Earth and its diverse life from the harmful
      radiation coming from the Sun.</p>

      <p>Unlike the other planets in our Solar System which are named after
      Greek/Roman deities, Earth is named after the English/German word for
      ground: eor(th)e and ertha (Old English) and erde (German).</p>

      <h2>Mars</h2>

      <p>Mars is known as the Red Planet due to the abundant iron oxide. Mars
      orbits the Sun in about 687 Earth days and completes a rotation on its
      axis very similar to Earth&rsquo;s (24hours 37mins 22 secs).</p>

      <p>Mars does have a thin atmosphere and has epic dust storms that span
      thousands of kilometers across and sometimes engulf the entire planet in
      a haze of dust. This haze traps extra heat from the sun and temporarily
      raises surface temperatures.</p>

      <p>Mars&rsquo; topography is far from ordinary. Olympus Mons, a massive
      shield volcano, rises to roughly three times the height of Mt. Everest
      (above sea level), and is the second highest mountain that we know of in
      our Solar System. Valles Marineris is a gigantic canyon system that
      dwarfs our Grand Canyon in comparison.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its main canyons run
      roughly the length of the entire continental United States (roughly
      4000km), reaching depths of up to 7km (~4.3mi).</p>

      <h2>Jupiter</h2>

      <p>The largest planet in our Solar System is Jupiter. It has the
      shortest rotational period of all the planets in the solar system,
      completing its rotation in just under 10 hours (9h 55m), and completes
      its orbit about the Sun in approximately 11 Earth years 315 Earth
      days.</p>

      <p>Jupiter has a very thick atmosphere and is continuously covered with
      clouds. The banded appearance of &ldquo;belts and zones&rdquo; are
      rising or falling gases in elevation parallel to Jupiter&rsquo;s
      equator. (Dark bands are descending gases while light bands are rising
      gases.)</p>

      <p>The Great Red Spot, perhaps Jupiter&rsquo;s most famous feature, is a
      giant anticyclonic* storm that varies in size (24-40,000 km east-to-west
      by 12-14,000 km north-to-south). Observations show that this storm may
      be slowly reducing in size over time.</p>

      <p>Jupiter&rsquo;s system of moons is impressive; latest count of
      Jupiter&rsquo;s natural satellites is 67. Io, Europa, Ganymede and
      Callisto are the four largest and well-known moons.</p>

      <h2>Saturn</h2>

      <p>Another of our Solar System&rsquo;s gas giants, Saturn is the second
      largest planet in our Solar System. It takes Saturn a whopping 10,759
      Earth days (~29.5 Earth years) to complete its orbit about the Sun.
      Saturn has a similar rotational period to Jupiter completing its
      rotation in roughly 10 hours.</p>

      <p>Saturn&rsquo;s famous rings extend out to 102,000 km above
      Saturn&rsquo;s equator and are composed of mostly water ice. The rings
      are made up of particles ranging vastly in size (from very small
      particles to the size of large boulders).&nbsp;&nbsp; Several hypotheses
      have been made about how the rings have been formed, but astronomers
      don&rsquo;t know with certainty how the rings initially formed.</p>

      <p>There are at least 150 moons and moonlets* identified orbiting
      Saturn, of which are named. Titan is Saturn&rsquo;s largest moon by far;
      Rhea, the second largest, may even have its own ring system!</p>

      <h2>Uranus</h2>

      <p>Uranus appears to us as an almost featureless planet, composed
      primarily of hydrogen and helium. Uranus&rsquo; orbit around the Sun
      takes 84 Earth years and Uranus completes a rotation on its axis every
      17.9 hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Uranus is unique in that its axis is tilted to 97.77˚ making its
      rotation roughly perpendicular to the other planets&rsquo; axial tilts.
      As a result of this unusual tilt, the planet&rsquo;s 20-year seasons
      experiences extreme variations in sunlight.</p>

      <h2>Neptune</h2>

      <p>Neptune is the farthest planet in the Solar System, and like its
      neighbors is a gaseous planet. Its orbit is a staggering 164.79 Earth
      years and it rotates on its axis roughly every 16 hours.</p>

      <p>There are 14 known moons that orbit Neptune, the largest being
      Triton, which is suggested have been a Kuiper Belt* object that was
      captured by Neptune&rsquo;s gravitational field.</p>

      <h2>Pluto</h2>

      <p>Pluto, once thought to be a planet in our Solar System, is the
      largest object in the Kuiper Belt* and is classified as a dwarf planet.
      It takes 248 Earth years to complete its orbit about the Sun; Pluto
      rotates much more slowly on its axis than Earth, taking 6.39 Earth days
      to complete a rotation. &nbsp;</p>

      <p>Pluto has five known moons, but Charon, its largest moon, is almost
      half Pluto&rsquo;s size&mdash;very large relative to typical planet-moon
      size ratios. This circumstance creates several interesting relationships
      in the Pluto-Charon system. The two objects are tidally locked and as
      such Pluto always presents the same face to Charon and vice versa. Their
      rotational periods are also equal. &nbsp;</p>
